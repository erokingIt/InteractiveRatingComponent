## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS CSS Pre-processor
- Used paint.net to determine component colors, dimensions, and padding/margins

### What I learned

- Learned how to use SASS to style a web page and in Visual Studio Code IDE
- How to write in SASS language, use variables, use mixins, and partials
- Adjusting the viewBox property of a SVG html tag

### Continued development

This was my first experience with SASS and I'd like to work with it more. I would like to explore more SASS features and how it can steamline my development. I want understand how to adjust SVG's in the simplest sense.
